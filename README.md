# SQL Task Manager
This is a React, Express, and SQL application that I made to practice making RESTful APIs with mySQL. This app allows users to register new tasks, mark tasks as done, show all tasks, and sort by priority. These tasks are stored in a mySQL database and accessed via the Node api in 'app.js'.
